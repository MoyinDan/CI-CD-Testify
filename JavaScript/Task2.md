#  JAVASCRIPT FUN FACTS

1. JavaScript came to life in a mere 10 days, thanks to Brendan Eich's rapid development at Netscape in 1995.

2. Despite sharing part of its name, JavaScript and Java are entirely unrelated, with JavaScript chosen to ride on Java's popularity wave.

3. The peculiar NaN (Not-a-Number) in JavaScript is technically of type number.

4. JavaScript stands as the dominant language for web development, finding support across all major web browsers.

5. Navigating the intricate web of asynchronous JavaScript code can lead to the infamous "Callback Hell."

6. JavaScript exhibits hoisting, where variable and function declarations move to the top of their scope during compilation.

7. The language boasts six falsy values, including false, 0, '', null, undefined, and NaN.

8. ES6, or ECMAScript 2015, revolutionized JavaScript with features like let and const keywords, arrow functions, and template literals.

9. The typeof operator might surprise you; for instance, typeof null yields 'object'.

10. JavaScript supports closures, allowing functions to retain access to outer scope variables even after execution completes.

11. Async/Await, introduced in ES2017, simplifies writing asynchronous code by adopting a more synchronous appearance.

12. Different web browsers use different JavaScript engines, such as V8 in Google Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox, and JavaScriptCore in Safari.

13. Prototype-based inheritance governs object relationships in JavaScript.

14. JavaScript's dynamic typing enables flexibility in variable types, but requires careful consideration.

15. Functions in JavaScript enjoy first-class status, permitting assignment to variables, passing as arguments, and returning from other functions.

16. Truthy values in JavaScript include non-empty strings and non-zero numbers, evaluating as true in boolean context.

17. JavaScript's "strict mode" serves as a tool to catch common coding errors and restrict certain error-prone features.

18. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) serves as a lightweight data interchange format for seamless communication between servers and web applications.

19. DOM manipulation, a key JavaScript role, empowers dynamic updates to web pages through the Document Object Model.

20. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) acts as a browser security feature, preventing web pages from making requests to domains other than their own.
