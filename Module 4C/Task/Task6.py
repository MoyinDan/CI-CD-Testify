# Conditional Statement and logical operators

# Declare two numbers with any values
# Check if the first number is greater than 50 and check if the second number is less than 100, if True print out "Evaluation is True"
# Add an else block that prints "Evaluation is False"
# Declare a string with value "python"
# Check if the first string is equal to "testify" or "python", if True prints out "Yay!! The string is a Testify Python".

# Use the logical and to check if the first number is greater than 50 and the second number is less than 100.
